## General Information
### Convex Hull Using Divide and Conquer Algorithm
A convex hull is a polygon composed of a subset of points such that for any two points on the plane (eg p and q), all line segments ending in p and q are in that set. The convex hull problem is a computational geometry problem and can be developed for computer animation, optimization, and statistics problems. To solve convex hull problem, this program use divide and conquer algorithm and recursion. This program is a python library that will return the convex hull of each label in the form of a list of data/points forming convex hull, then display it with a different color.

## Requirements
Python library:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlip.pyplot
- math
- sklearn (to load datasets)


## Usage
(LOCAL)
1. (First use only): Clone this repository, then change directory to src. `cd src`
2. Install the required python library
3. To run the library, open the "main.ipynb" file
4. Run the first cell to import all of the required library
5. Load dataset and create dataframe by running the first cell of each dataset
6. Run other cells to visualize the convex hull
